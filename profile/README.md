### Hello! Welcome to Buttondown.

Buttondown is the best way for you start and grow your newsletter. 

What does that mean? 

Well, that means a lot of things. You can probably get a better sense on Buttondown's [splash page](https://buttondown.email).

If you're here, though, you're probably interested in a couple things in particular. For instance, might I recommend starting with:

- ðŸš¦Buttondown's [public roadmap](https://github.com/buttondown-email/roadmap)
- ðŸ’°Buttondown's [sponsorships page](https://github.com/orgs/buttondown-email/sponsoring), through which I've donated back thousands of dollars to the open source software that's enabled Buttondown's growth & success
- ðŸ“œButtondown's [documentation](https://github.com/buttondown-email/docs), which is hosted on `docs.buttondown.email`
- ðŸ“œButtondown's [blog](https://github.com/buttondown-email/blog), which is hosted on `blog.buttondown.email`
